# code_wars

This is the repo I am planning to upload all my code wars challenges to. 

It was all getting a bit messy in my Github, so thought this might be nice to tidy up a little bit: put lots of files within this repo, and then they all contain the tests and the programs. 

Plan is for a 'programs' folder, and a 'tests' folder. Will divide up from there.
